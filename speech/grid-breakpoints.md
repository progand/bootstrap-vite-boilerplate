Hey everyone, it's Andriy, and in this quick video, I'll show you how to easily change the responsive breakpoints in a Bootstrap 5 project.

First, let's check the `index.html` file. You can find a container with a row and several columns there. Here's how it looks in the browser.

Next, let's open our main SCSS file and add a new variable named `grid-breakpoints`. We'll make some changes to the breakpoints. Don't forget to save the file and then open the browser.

Now, you can see the modified responsive grid in action.

That's it! You've successfully modified the responsive breakpoints in Bootstrap 5.
